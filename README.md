<p>Developed during ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. This python script used to notify me whenever there was a 4,6 or a wicket in an over.

You can make simple edits in the code to make the notification service work in your desired manner. 
Example - You want to be notified when there are 2 wickets in an over or 2 sixes, etc.
