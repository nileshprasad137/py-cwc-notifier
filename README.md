<h1 id="py-cwc-notifier">Py-CWC-Notifier</h1>
<p>Developed during ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. This python script used<br>
to notify me whenever there was a 4,6 or a wicket in an over.</p>
<p>You can make simple edits in the code to make the notification<br>
service work in your desired manner. Example - You want to be<br>
notified when there are 2 wickets in an over or 2 sixes, etc.</p>
